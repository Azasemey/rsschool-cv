**_About_**

The goal is to become a confident front-end developer.
I work as a content manager at epiccarry.com remotely. I have experience using WordPress. For some time I worked closely with the developers and I liked what they do. I am ready to spend all my spare time learning HTML / CSS / JS

**_Skills_**

Basic knowledge of HTML / CSS. Also solving tasks on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Azasemey/) level **7-6 kyu**. I try to stick to the **DRY** principles.
