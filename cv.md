**_About_**

The goal is to become a confident front-end developer.
I work as a content manager at epiccarry.com remotely. I have experience using WordPress. For some time I worked closely with the developers and I liked what they do. I am ready to spend all my spare time learning HTML / CSS / JS

---

**_Skills_**

Basic knowledge of HTML / CSS. Also solving tasks on [CodeWars](https://www.codewars.com/users/Azasemey/) level **7-6 kyu**. I try to stick to the **DRY** principles.

---

**_Code example_**

```javascript
function spinWords(string) {
  const str = string.split(" ");
  const spinned = str.map((v) =>
    v.length > 4 ? (v = v.split("").reverse().join("")) : (v = v)
  );
  return spinned.join(" ");
}
```

**_Languages_**

- Russian (native)
- English level - C2. [EF SET certificate](https://www.efset.org/cert/NQhhXd). But my speaking skill is not that high as listening / reading /writing.
